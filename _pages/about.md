Hello! I'm Rahul, a Master's student in Robotics at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://robotics.umich.edu/).

Currently, I am part of the FCAV Lab, working under the supervision of [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](https://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal) and [Prof. Katie Skinner](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/team). My research focuses on developing safe motion planning algorithms for robotic arms and mobile robots, utilizing reachability and Gaussian splatting scene representation.

I also briefly worked at the ARM Lab under the guidance of [Prof. Dimitry Berenson](https://berenson.robotics.umich.edu/), where I focused on generating simplified mesh representations for efficient motion planning in deformable object manipulation.

I earned my B.Tech (Honors) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). As an undergraduate researcher at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in//), I developed robust controllers for drones with varying payloads. I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Spandan Roy, Prof. Madhava Krishna, and Prof. Harikumar Kandath, and I had the opportunity to present our work at various conferences and competitions.
